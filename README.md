# Golang Respoke Lib

This library barely works and is not finished. It has no tests. Run away!

## About

Respoke uses the Socket.IO 0.9 protocol with a specific messaging format. Respoke also has a
REST API.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/ruffrey/go-respoke
```

## Examples

See `examples` folder. You will need to have a Socket.IO server for testing.
